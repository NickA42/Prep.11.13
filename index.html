      <h1>How did Dr.B create the transition?</h1>
      <p>For starters, based on chapter 9 of the reading, Dr.B created those transitions by using a <q>.transition()</q> link. This link 
      has to be placed after the <q>.data</q> link and before the <q>.attr()</q> link. 
      The link <q>.transition</q> is used to transform one graph to another, it is much simpler in d3 than one may think it is. D3 basically does all
      of the work for you, it takes the beginning and ending values of a subject and inserts those into their calculation of the duration
      of the transition. For the duration of the transition, Dr.B simply used a <q>.duration()</q> link. This link is used to provide the transition
      with a time set on how long it will take to make the transition. Within the parenthesis of the <q>.duration()</q> tag, you put in numbers 
      but in milliseconds. So if you want a 1 second transition, you put (after the duration tag) <q>1000</q> because 1000 milliseconds is 1 second. 
      I also believe Dr.B used some of the extra functions like delay and ease. Delay was put before the duration because theres a delay to the transition.
      Also the .ease was used for making the form of the transition. He obviously used an on click function for the transition to actually work when clicked on.
        For the info given in chapter 10, my guess is that Dr.B used a sort function within d3 transition and added the CSS styling elements 
        to give the colors (red or green) for people who have declined or improved in their exam scores.
